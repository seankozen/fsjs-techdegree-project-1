# Random Quote Generator
 Random Quote Generator
Generates a random quote each time the "Show another quote" button is clicked and the background color changes automatically each time.
It also automatically generates a random quote every 10 seconds and the background color changes without clicking the button.
## How I worked on this project
- I built this app based mockup images.
## How to navigate this project
- App can be accessed through the index.html file.
## Why I built the project this way
- My plan is to become a full-stack developer eventually, but for this project I focused on the
  frontend.  This project focused on Javascript practice and DOM manipulation. 
## If I had more time I would change this
- Connect to a database with more quotes, or a quote API.
